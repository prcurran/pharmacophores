// This file is included in all POVRay output files created by CCDC software.
// Once created, it will not be overwritten.
// One way to use this file is to paste into it copies of individual ccdc_* macros
// from an original .pov, and then modify the macro definitions.
// These modified macros will then automatically override the standard CCDC macros.
